# Traffic Sign Recognition using Machine Learning:

This project realized during my first year of university successfully classified some traffic signs with a performance over 95%.
I had to search for pictures, preprocess them, extract data and train some models on it.

# Warning

It might not be usable as it uses a personal library given by my teacher, that is not accessible here. But the project can still be looked at and used by copy/paste, and diaporoma.md is a good summary of it (in French).
